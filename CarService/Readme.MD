It started in the laboratory and finished by me.

The project contains a Car class, a CarService (Singleton).
For each car we have the name, color and an array of reviews (initially empty).

In main, the class methods are called through a "menu", consisting of a switch with the following options:

         0. Exit Application
         1. List all system cars
         2. Add new car in the system
         3. Add new review to a car (using its name)
